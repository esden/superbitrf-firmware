This is an example of a data transfer between two usbrf modules.
It includes a transmitter and a receiver, and to compile the receiver add "RECEIVER=1" to your make command.

It will toggle the red light when the packet is transmitted or received, and it will toggle the orange light when the packet was correctly transmitted or received.
